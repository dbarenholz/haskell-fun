# haskell-fun

This is my playground for learning haskell, a functional programming language that makes my brain hurt.


## Points

Before I knew how painful records were, I made `points.hs`.
It's probably a lot nicer to just use `(0, 1)` as tuple in stead.

## Fibs

A classic problem. Get an infinite list with `fibs`, a list up to some index `n` with `fibTo n`, and a singular fibonacci number of some index `i` with `fibOf i`.
